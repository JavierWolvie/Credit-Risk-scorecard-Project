pandas: For data manipulation and creating loan-related features (e.g., Debt-to-Income ratios).
numpy: For numerical operations and handling large arrays.
scikit-learn: The primary library for machine learning, providing tools for data splitting, scaling, and standard models like Logistic Regression. 

Machine Learning Models
Credit risk projects often benefit from ensemble models that handle non-linear relationships well: 
xgboost: High-performance gradient boosting; widely used for tabular data.
lightgbm or catboost: Alternatives to XGBoost that are often faster or better at handling categorical data (like "home ownership status"). 

 Visualization & Reporting
matplotlib and seaborn: For plotting credit score distributions, correlation heatmaps, and ROC-AUC curves.
